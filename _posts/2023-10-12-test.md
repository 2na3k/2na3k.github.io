## New blog since I'm bored
I got bored on workdays, and saw [this webpage](https://ntietz.com/) of an developer, so I forked it.

What I would do with this blog:
- Write proper technical things (since ok it's good enough to have some proper notes).
- Simplify the method of taking notes since I don't usually write that much.
- Do more maths (with the $$f(x)$$ things), and actually enjoy creating things.

## And neo-brutalism? 
Yes, more. [Check this](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/the-neubrutalism-or-neo-brutalism-ui-design-trend-641714825fed)

## Boring tech?
I love boring tech and I have a strong feeling that there are some changes aren't neccessary that much. Like old computers still can do many weird things.
